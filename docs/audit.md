**What the app does well:**
- Very clean UI, button icons are intuitive
- Good information in the external links to reduce carbon footprints
- Dates read out properly on semantic label–good attention to that detail
- Good contrast on text makes everything readable

**What the app could improve:**
- Tapping the icons on the map is a bit difficult
- Semantic label for home icon can be more detailed.


**_Accessibility Issue #1_**
**Name/Brief Description** - Read aloud on home page icon
**Testing Method** - Voice over
**Guideline violated** - Guideline 1.1.1
**Evidence** - Voice over just says that the home page has an icon, but doesn’t say what the icon looks like.
**Explanation** - Home page icon is missing information in semantic label.
**Severity Rating** - Cosmetic
**Justification** - Guideline 1.1.1 says to provide text alternatives of images that serve the equivalent purpose; however, I user would not know what the icon looks like.
**Possible Solution** - Add to the semantic label that the logo is a leaf.

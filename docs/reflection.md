**Identify which of the course topics you applied (e.g. secure data persistence) and describe how you applied them.**  
In addition to the list of topics enumerated above, you must also describe how your app design reflects what you learned about the Properties of People - Mason

**Discuss how doing this project challenged and/or deepened your understanding of these topics.**

**Describe what changed from your original concept to your final implementation? Why did you make those changes from your original design vision?**  
The primary change in our design was shifting from a user goal-based system to tracking the cumulative amount of CO₂ saved.

**Original Concept:**  
We initially planned for users to set specific goals related to their recycling activities (e.g., recycling X number of items or achieving a certain CO₂ savings target).

**Final Implementation:**  
The final design focuses exclusively on tracking and displaying the amount of CO₂ saved through recycling. Goals are no longer part of the user experience.

**Reason for the Change:**  
This adjustment simplifies the user experience by focusing on the most impactful metric: CO₂ savings. It also aligns better with our primary aim—raising awareness of environmental impact—without requiring users to set and manage goals, which could feel cumbersome or unnecessary.

**Describe two areas of future work for your app, including how you could increase the accessibility and usability of this app**  
Currently, the "Click Here" button on the map screen is not immediately intuitive for users to find, as it requires scrolling. To enhance accessibility:
- We plan to redesign the layout to ensure all critical actions are visible without scrolling, such as repositioning or resizing the button to make it prominent.

A major enhancement for usability involves integrating a feature where users can input items they need to dispose of, and the app will provide tailored disposal or recycling instructions. This would include:
- A search bar where users can type the name of an item (e.g., "batteries" or "electronics").
- Leveraging an AI-powered database to provide precise recycling instructions based on the item and the user's location. This feature would empower users with actionable information, making recycling more accessible and personalized to their needs.

**What do you feel was the most valuable thing you learned in CSE 340 that will help you beyond this class, and why?**  
Avni: Working with Flutter was a game-changer for me. It’s an intuitive framework that made learning app development far more enjoyable compared to other frameworks like React. Its versatility for cross-platform development and amazing set of widgets made creating applications straightforward and efficient. Beyond the technical skills, I also learned about the importance of UI design, usability, and accessibility.

Another critical takeaway was learning how to problem-solve independently. Early on, I leaned heavily on office hours, but I grew to understand the value of going online to research and troubleshoot issues first. Developing this problem-solving mindset has been empowering and will serve me well in future technical challenges.

**If you could go back and give yourself 2-3 pieces of advice at the beginning of the class, what would you say and why? (Alternatively: what 2-3 pieces of advice would you give to future students who take CSE 340 and why?)**

**Advice to My Past Self**  
Avni: 
- Don’t hesitate to ask for help or input from peers, instructors, or TAs. Receiving feedback is crucial, whether it’s for improving your code, refining your designs, or brainstorming new ideas. Collaboration is one of the best ways to grow.
  
- Starting early allows you to experiment with new ideas and features, rather than rushing to meet deadlines. This extra time leads to more creative and polished applications.
  
- While researching solutions online is a critical skill, don’t be afraid to reach out when you're stuck. Finding the right balance between independent problem-solving and seeking help can save time and deepen your understanding.

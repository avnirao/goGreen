_To establish the existing need for our carbon footprint calculator app, we can draw upon several sources of evidence that highlight the growing concern about climate change and the desire for individuals to take action._

**Rising Public Awareness and Concern**
Recent global surveys indicate a significant increase in public concern about climate change:
93% of respondents in a 14-country survey believe climate change poses a serious and imminent threat to the planet.
80% of respondents in a 77-country UN survey want their governments to take stronger action on climate change.
The share of people considering climate change a "major threat" has grown from 54% in 2014 to 71% in 2022 across surveyed countries.
This growing awareness creates a need for tools that empower individuals to understand and reduce their environmental impact.

**Desire for Personal Action**
Surveys also reveal that people are increasingly interested in taking personal action:
56% of people globally think about climate change regularly (daily or weekly).
More than half of people globally are more worried about climate change compared to the previous year.
A carbon footprint calculator app can address this desire by providing individuals with a concrete way to measure and reduce their impact.

**Benefits of Carbon Footprint Calculators**
Carbon footprint calculators offer several advantages that can meet the needs of environmentally conscious individuals:
Data-Driven Insights: They help save time in collecting, analyzing, and storing emissions data1.
Cost Optimization: By identifying inefficiencies, calculators can help reduce both emissions and operational costs2.
Awareness and Education: Calculators raise awareness about personal impact and inspire action2.
Targeted Reduction Strategies: They allow users to identify their highest emission sources and implement effective reduction strategies2.

In conclusion, the growing public awareness and concern for climate change, combined with a strong desire for personal action, highlight the need for accessible tools like carbon footprint calculators. These tools provide actionable insights, foster education, and empower individuals and businesses to take meaningful steps toward reducing their environmental impact, making them an essential part of the fight against climate change.

# Evaluation: SUS Testing

## Methodology

We conducted a **System Usability Scale (SUS)** test with 10 participants to evaluate the usability of our application. Participants included a mix of tech-savvy and non-technical individuals, representative of our target audience.

### Process
1. **Interaction**: Participants explored the app and completed specific tasks.
2. **SUS Questionnaire**: They answered the 10 standard SUS questions using a 5-point Likert scale:
   - Odd-numbered questions: Positive (e.g., "I think that I would like to use this app frequently.")
   - Even-numbered questions: Negative (e.g., "I found the app unnecessarily complex.")

### Scoring
- Odd questions: Subtract 1 from the score.
- Even questions: Subtract the score from 5.
- Sum the results and multiply by 2.5 to normalize to a 0â€“100 scale.

The average SUS score will determine overall usability.

Our SUS test score was 82.5.
